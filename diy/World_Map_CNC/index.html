So this time I finally decided to make one by myself.</p><h1>Materials and Tools</h1><h2>List of Materials</h2><ul><li>Scrapwood</li></ul><h2>Used Maschines</h2><ul><li>CNC</li><li>Used bits (10mm, 6mm, 3mm and 1mm) <img src="CNC.png" alt="CNC"/>{:height="780px" width="520px"} <br /></li></ul><h1>Build it</h1><p>This time I wanted to clean out my old scrapwood. From other projects I had left a couple of different wood types laying around. I'm not really sure what all the types are, but in any case there are: mahogany, birch, ash, white oak and some other types. <img src="Wood_sample.png" alt="Wood_sample"/>{:height="1000px" width="800px"} <br /> (BILD DER HOLZKISTE MIT HÖLZERN)</p><h1>First Steps</h1><p>I started by sorting the material. My CNC has a working space of 300x350mm. Unfortunately my biggest scrap piece that was laying around was only 250x300mm, so I decided to step down a little bit. The Result you can see (Bild des Ergebnis verlinke) has a dimension of around 250x200mm.</p><p>I thought about different patterns, for example being symmetric from the middle (Bild: Symmetrischer Aufbau) or using a rainbow pattern (different colors from the top to the buttom) but decided to make every continent/country in their own wood type. As you can imagine this took a lot of preparating time at the cnc, and I will probably not do this any time soon.</p><p>After I decided which pattern I want to use, I prepair the woods. Some of them had holes and other had big outbreaks, so I cut them in their right size. I also sanded them flat, although I will cut them later on the cnc. But sanding the buttom first, the tape will hold way better.</p><h1>CNC Preparation</h1><p>Unfortunately, the direction of movement of my CNC mill in the Z-axis is very small. So I used a sacrificial block to raise the height. I planned it down and fixed all my parts with some tape and hot glue. I could also use CA-glue but in my opinion hot glue is good enough for nearly all my cases and it is also way cheaper. &gt; If you never heard of the trick: just tape both parts and clue them on the tapes together (CA-glue or hot glue). The parts will hold really well and if you take them apart you will not scratch or dent any part.</p><h1>CNC Process</h1><p>The process for the map and all the inlets (continents) where nearly the same. - First I started with a 6mm flat cutter (3 flute) to roughed out all the countrys. - After roughing out I switched to a 3mm flat cutter with damond tooth. I decided to use diamond tooth because they cut the wood so fast and sharp, that no chips are produced, but only dust. This was really useful for all the small details and sharp corners - I finished everything up with a 1mm flat cutter (also with diamond tooth). This gave me the perfect fit and also a really smooth edge. Unfortunately I droped the cutter after the first cut, so I had to change to a normal 1mm 3 flute cutter.</p><p>&gt;If you safe the shavings for later you can use them in the glueing process to fill all the small holes.</p><p>The process for cutting out all the continents and countrys were nearly the same, the only different was, that all cuts where outside cuts.</p><p>So I step forward and did that for every single cut. Like I said before I will not do this in the distant future, I would rather glue all the boards together and cut it ones on the cnc.</p><p>→ As you can see in some pictures I hit the got glue more than ones and this clogged my cutter really bad. I could easily remove the glue after the cuts but this also means that the cutter didn't cut and ruther rubbed the material away.</p><h1>Glueing time</h1><p>Next step was glueing time. Some parts needed some help fitting into the main part, so I used some sanding paper to fit the corners perfectly. I used wood glue to glue the parts together. What really helps me fitting the parts perfectly together was saving the shavings as I mentioned before. You can really rub the shavings into the small cracks and holes you faded all the small mistakes away.</p><h1>Final Cut and Sanding</h1><p>After letting everything dry over night, the next step was the final cut. I cutted out an elliptical shape and also planted it down a bit.</p><p>Finally I sanded everything down. I started with 80 grid and increased until I reached 200 grid.</p><h1>Finish</h1><p>For the finish I definitely choiced the wrong oil. I used some walnut oil and this was for sure the wrong option a lighter oil like linseed oil would be perfect so the mahogany (Africa and Australia) could really pop out. Also the ash I used for the Antarctica disappear in the birch. You can really see that in the before and after picture.
